# Repository for SOSA submission related to Demi God numbers in the Rubiks cube

We use the solver from Elias Frantar (et al.): https://github.com/efrantar/rob-twophase

To compile simply run `make`.

To solve <N> cubes sampled uniformly at random, using at most <m> milliseconds per cube and <t> threads, run
```
./twophase -n <N> -m <m> -t <t>
```

This will result in a text file `sol.cubes`, containing stastitics and information for verification.

The description of each scramble follows Kociemba's representation, as described in https://github.com/efrantar/rob-twophase/blob/master/src/face.h 

The file `experiments.cubes` contains the information corresponding to the 500.000 random solves used in the paper.
